## school projects
### school year of 2022-2023

During this year, I took a coding elective through my highschool. They did 90% of the coding for me, but here's the projects I rewrote from the ground up to be more readable, efficient, and logical.

the `we-truck-it_original.txt` file contains the original code my school wanted me to write. Then they wanted me to add another section to test another data set, but instead of adding another 40 lines of code, i decided to rewrite it to be more modular.
