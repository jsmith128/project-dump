## Wiremod Expression 2 Simfphys Vehicle Controller
### 10/23/2019 / 6/15/2022

This is something i've worked on a couple times over the last few years. So there is an addon for Garry's Mod called "simfphys LUA Vehicles" that adds custom vehicles to the game. One of the more interesting features about it is the fact that you can control said vehicles using Wiremod. Using Wiremod's E2 scripting language, I made a little thing that will drive a simfphys vehicle towards a specified object. It's not very useful but it was a fun project to work on. 

Here you can see two versions of the code. v3 was the last version I made the first time I worked on it. v6 is the latest version that I made a few years later. The biggest changes is the support for wiremod thrusters to be placed on the corners of the vehicle. If the car is rotated too much it will activate the thrusters to place it back on the ground again.
