## LUA projects
### 3/11/2019 - 3/19/2019

most of these are nothing special. I wrote these all very early on. 

`cardgame.lua` might be the most advanced thing i made with lua, and i don't think it even works. I was trying to recreate UNO but it went way past my expertise. 

`simon.lua` was going to be simon says, but i gave up on that before i even started.
