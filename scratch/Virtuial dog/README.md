## Virtuial dog
### 6/09/2016

my very first scratch project. I think aside from code.org, this was my first exposure to this sort of thing. All I did was follow the tutorial scratch provided at the time. I'm not sure if it still exists. 

#### Original description:

##### Instructions

Click on the dog to make him go back to the starting spot.  
Click on the apple to make the dog eat it witch will give him 3 less hungry  
Click on the ball to make him play with it  
and most importantly have fun!

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I may add more things to do so do not be mad if you don't like it because it does not have very many features.

##### Notes and Credits
