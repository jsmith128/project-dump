## new tab website
### 5/18/2021 - 6/5/2021

so i wanted to make a custom new tab page for firefox. I was going to add links to any useful pages i go to frequently. so i build the page, i add the links, i even add an rss feed. but then when i go to add it as the default new tab, i find out they made it so you cant use local pages for security reasons. i get it but it's dumb and i'm still mad i went through all that work.

anyway, it's a neat little website. i removed all of my personal info of course.
