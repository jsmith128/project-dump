gm_Usandbox is a sandbox map that I made for Garry's mod a while ago.
It has quate a few features, such as a pool, an underground area, a huge building area, and more!

The_Crusher is some random map I made for Half-life 2. It was the first map I had put a lot of effort into.
It takes place in some kind of sewer/drainage system, that leads to a crusher. 
Your task is to find a way out of the crusher.
