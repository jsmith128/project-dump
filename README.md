Big collection of most of my projects that don't deserve their own repo. Most code is from 2020-2022, but some go as far back as 2016, and as near as 2023.

In the future I might put some of these projects into their own repositories because I'm actually proud of them.

I believe the most that's missing right now is a couple of garry's mod expression2 chip files.
