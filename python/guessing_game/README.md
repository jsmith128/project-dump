a simple number guessing game i made a while back. it's ugly but it works i suppose.

The most notable aspect of this game is that it has a settings menu, however it crashes as soon as you finish setting it up. Also I dont think i undestood the usefulness of classes or arguments.

`print('Good job! It only took you {}/{} guesses!\n'.format(str(int(maxGuesses-guesses)),str(int(maxGuesses))))` might be one of the worst lines of code i've ever written. I'm sorry. I remember being very confused.
