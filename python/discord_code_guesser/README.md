## discord code guesser
### 4/29/2021

FOR FUN i decided to make a python script to check a bunch of random discord codes and see if there's an associated gift. I was not going to use the gift, i just wanted to know if such a thing was possible. I have no interest in stealing dicord gifts from random people. I was only curious as to how easy it would be for a bad actor to ACTUALLY steal a gift before it is redeemed. I love discord and its users and i have no intention of disturbing peace and STEALING something. I have never and would never steal something.
