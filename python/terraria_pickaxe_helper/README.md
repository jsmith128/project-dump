## pickos / tPicks
### 3/17/2020 - 3/19/2020

This one makes me sad. I spent SO much time on this, but I ended up scrapping the idea because as it turns out it's inconvenient to have a dedicated python program to tell you what pickaxe you should get in Terraria.

There was so much manual labor involved in collecting pickaxe data, turning each pickaxe into objects in python to be used by code that doesn't exist.

I had no idea what I was doing, but I really liked the idea of this, and so I kept working on it for an above-average amount of time. I believe this is the first project in which I tried using classes.
