## matplotlib minecraft ores graph
### 1/26/2020 - 1/27/2020

Frustrated by the unusefulness of the Minecraft Wiki's [ore distribution chart](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Ore?oldid=1477181&file=PercentOfOreByHeight.png), I decided to take matters into my own hands. Armed with data from the very same article, I got to work. I learned how to use matplotlib. Despite my confusion and many speed bumps, I eventually produced something decent and readable. If only I had the courage to add it to the Minecraft Wiki page.

As you can see, I had a bit of a false start with `minecraftOres.py`, but the next day I wrote `ores2.py` and finally got it finished.
