These are a collection of small handy scripts for converting media filetypes. Simply drag a file onto a desired program, and the rest is handled for you.

Requires `ffmpeg.exe` in this directory.

It's very easy to make your own converter for a filetype supported by FFmpeg, just copy an existing converter and change the second argument in the `base.convert()` function.

If you need a quick png-to-gif converter, see [png2gif.py](pngtogif/readme.md)
