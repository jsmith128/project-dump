## to-mp4 (old version)
### 1/08/2020

This is the original version of my ffmpeg_shortcuts project. I had made this to quickly convert .mkv videos to .mp4. It's clearly much more simplistic than the current version. 

This version uses ffmpy, and honestly i might switch the new version to that in the future. I can't remember why i wanted to go the route of calling ffmpeg.exe with the `system()` function.
