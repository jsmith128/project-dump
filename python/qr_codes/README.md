## qr code experimentation
### 1/11/2020

I wanted to make a qr code reader with python after seeing all the qr codes in the talos principle, as i didn't have any other reasonable way to read them. Once I realized it would be a lot of work to make a reader, I settled on making a qr code _generator_. It's clearly very simple and 99% of the work is done by the `pyqrcode` library, but I had fun with this.
