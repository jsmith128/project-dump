## Tournament Matchup Maker
### 8/2/2020

back in early-mid 2020 i was a part of a shell shockers team that was a part of an actual shell shockers league. I never played it much but i made this script to randomly match up our teammates to 1v1 with each other. I handed it over to the manager of the team and he understandably did not use it. I never asked if he wanted me to make it, but i did anyway, so i can't blame him. It solves a very specific task that takes only minutes to do by hand.

also you can see in `a.py` i was experimenting with the modulo operator and getting a feel for how it works.
