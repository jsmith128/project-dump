## ffmpeg video editor
### 11/14/2022

This program is a very minimalistic video editor(trimmer). You drag a file onto the video_editor.bat file, and then enter the desired start and stop points. Then the program cuts out everything other than your selection. Very handy for quickly making a short clip from a longer video. Originally created for shortening a video you want to send on discord because it can't handle big videos.

To use this program, you need to put `ffmpeg.exe` in the same directory. Very likely windows only.
