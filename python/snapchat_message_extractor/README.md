## snapchat saved chat history exporter
### 09/20/2023

Takes a snapchat chat history .json file (can be exported from data page in the app/website), and exports the individual messages to a txt file. Currently can only export either sent or recieved messages, not both. Also does not differentiate between chats, so it's all one big mess. Feel free to fix it yourself because i dont care â™¥.

ONLY EXTRACTS SAVED MESSAGES!!!!
