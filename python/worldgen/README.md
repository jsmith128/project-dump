## world generator
### 1/27/2023

This program generates a random world with countries, states, cities, roads, houses, and people. Then the user can view the world with a simple CLI. Just names of things, nothing more.

I had originally made this because of a little idea i had for a messaging app where you have a virtual address and depending on how far away you are from other people, your mail will take longer to send. It's not practical to say the least, but it was a fun idea that turned out to be much harder to execute than i had expected.
