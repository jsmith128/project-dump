in the middle of a POV-Ray obsession, I had made this little python script for blender. It takes all of the triangles in a blender mesh and converts them to a POV-Ray mesh description. It's very simple but works well. I just couldn't figure out why I couldn't get the blender vertex normals to cooperate with POV-Ray; meaning smooth_triangles are broken with this script at this point.
